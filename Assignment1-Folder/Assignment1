Assignment 1: CPE 303 Object Oriented Programming 
Develop an employee management system using multiple inheritance and virtual inheritance in C++. You will create a class hierarchy for managing different types of employees, including full-time employees and part-time employees.
Requirements:
Create a base class Employee with the following attributes and methods:
Name
Employee ID
getInfo() method to display employee details.
Create a derived class FullTimeEmployee that inherits from Employee and has the properties:
Salary
getInfo() method to display full-time employee details.
Create another derived class PartTimeEmployee that also inherits from Employee and has the properties:
Hourly wage
Hours worked
getInfo() method to display part-time employee details.
Implement the Employee class and the derived classes with multiple inheritance:
Use multiple inheritance to allow FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee to inherit from Employee.
Use virtual inheritance to ensure there's only one instance of Employee in the inheritance hierarchy.
In the main function:
Create objects of FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.
Display the details of both types of employees using the getInfo() method.
NB: Use your personal full name as either a Full time Employee or Part-Time Employee
